This is the new catonmat.net website.

I have around 100 ideas of what a modern, state of the art, personal website
should have.

I will explain all my ideas in an article series "Designing the new
catonmat.net together with me." I have all the ideas on 4 A4 sheets I'll scan
and digitalize them as I start writing the articles.

Update:
    I wrote more than 50 of them down in ideas.txt, take a look.
    I also published them to catonmat.net as an article:
    http://www.catonmat.net/blog/50-ideas-for-the-new-catonmat-website/

This readme.txt file will be updated as I go to reflect full history of making
the new catonmat.net
