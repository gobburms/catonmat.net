Dear !NAME! !SURNAME!,

This is Peteris Krumins from catonmat.net writing to you. I'm writing because a while ago you bought my second e-book "Sed One-Liners Explained." I hope you enjoyed it!

I want to let you know that I've now published my third e-book "Perl One-Liners Explained."

http://www.catonmat.net/blog/perl-book/

The new e-book is 111 pages long and it explains 130 uniqe Perl one-liners. Many of one-liners are presented in several different ways so the total number of one-liners in the book is over 200.

The e-book is divided into the following chapters:

    Preface.
    1. Introduction to Perl One-Liners.
    2. Spacing.
    3. Numbering.
    4. Calculations
    5. String Creation and Array Creation.
    6. Text Conversion and Substitution.
    7. Selective Printing and Deleting of Lines.
    8. Handy Regular Expressions.
    9. perl1line.txt
    Appendix A. Perl's Special Variables.
    Index.

It took me quite some time to complete and it's just great. If you enjoyed my sed e-book, you'll also enjoy this one!
