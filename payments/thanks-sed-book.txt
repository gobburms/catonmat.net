Dear !NAME! !SURNAME!,

Thank you for buying my "Sed One-Liners Explained" e-book. Please find your e-book attached as a PDF file.

I'd really appreciate if you tweeted about my e-book. It took me so much time to get it done and tweeting would really help to get it out. Here is a quick link for tweeting:

Sed One-Liners Explained is my 2nd e-book. My previous one is "Awk One-Liners Explained". It contains 70 well explained Awk one-liners for all life situations in the shell. For more information see the announcement blog post:

I've now also written my 3rd e-book called "Perl One-Liners Explained". It teaches Perl one-liners the fun way. Take a look here, if you're interested:

I love writing about programming so much that I'm now working on several other e-books! The next few are going to be a guide to vim, a practical guide to anonymity online, and the catonmat book that will contain my best articles.


Sincerely,
