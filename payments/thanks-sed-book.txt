Dear !NAME! !SURNAME!,

Thank you buying my "Sed One-Liners Explained" e-book. Please find your e-book attached as a PDF file.

I'd really appreciate if you tweeted about my e-book. It took me so much time to get it done and tweeting would really help to get it out. Here is a quick link for tweeting:

I'd also like to add that this is my second e-book. My previous one is "Awk One-Liners Explained". It contains 70 well explained Awk one-liners for all life situations in the shell. For more info and a preview, take a look here:

I love writing about programming so I am now also working on my third book called "Perl One-Liners Explained". I'll be done with it in a couple of months and I'll publish it on my blog as well.


Sincerely,
