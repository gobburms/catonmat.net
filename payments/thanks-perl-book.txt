Dear !NAME! !SURNAME!,

Thank you for buying my Perl One-Liners Explained e-book. Please find your e-book attached as a PDF file.

I'd really appreciate if you tweeted about my e-book. It would really help to get it out. Here is a quick link for tweeting:

Perl One-Liners Explained is my 3rd e-book. My previous two are Awk One-Liners Explained and Sed One-Liners Explained:

I really love writing about programming so I'm going to be publishing several more books. I've planned writing a book on vim, a practical guide to anonymity, and the catonmat book that will contain my best articles.

Enjoy!


Sincerely,
