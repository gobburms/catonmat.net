Dear !NAME! !SURNAME!,

This is Peteris Krumins from catonmat.net writing to you. I am writing because a while ago you bought my first e-book "Awk One-Liners Explained." I hope you enjoyed it!

I want to let you know that, as promised, I have now published my second e-book "Sed One-Liners Explained."

http://www.catonmat.net/blog/sed-book/

The new e-book is 98 pages long and it explains exactly 100 sed one-liners. It's divided into the following chapters:

    Preface.
    1. Introduction to sed.
    2. Line Spacing.
    3. Line Numbering.
    4. Text Conversion and Substitution.
    5. Selective Printing of Certain Lines.
    6. Selective Deletion of Certain Lines.
    7. Special sed Applications.
    Appendix A. Summary of All sed Commands.
    Appendix B. Addresses and Ranges.
    Appendix C. Debugging sed Scripts with sed-sed.
    Index.

It took me about 3 months to complete and it's of the finest quality. If you enjoyed my first e-book you will also enjoy this one!
