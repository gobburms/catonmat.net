Dear !NAME! !SURNAME!,

Thank you for buying my "Awk One-Liners Explained" e-book. Please find your e-book attached as a PDF file.

I'd really appreciate if you tweeted about my e-book. It took me a lot of time to write and tweeting about it would really help to get it out. Here is a quick link for tweeting:

Also hear this, I have now published my second e-book called "Sed One-Liners Explained." Check it out here:

I love writing about programming so much that I am now working on my third book called "Perl One-Liners Explained". I'll be done with it in a couple of months and I'll publish it on my blog as well.


Sincerely,
