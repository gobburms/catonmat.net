Dear !NAME! !SURNAME!,

Thank you so much for buying my "Awk One-Liners Explained" e-book. Please find your e-book attached as a PDF file.

I'd really appreciate if you tweeted about my e-book. It took me a lot of time to write and tweeting about it would really help to get it out. Here is a quick link for tweeting:

PS. This is not my only e-book, I am also writing "Sed One-Liners Explained" and "Perl One-Liners Explained". I'll publish them soon on my blog!
