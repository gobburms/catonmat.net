Dear !NAME! !SURNAME!,

Thank you for buying my "Awk One-Liners Explained" e-book. Please find your e-book attached as a PDF file.

I'd really appreciate if you tweeted about my e-book. It took me a lot of time to write and tweeting about it would really help to get it out. Here is a quick link for tweeting:

Also I have now published two more e-books. The 2nd one is called "Sed One-Liners Explained" and 3rd one is "Perl One-Liners Explained". They are very similar to this Awk e-book. If you haven't seen them, here they are:

I love writing about programming so much that I am now working on several more e-books. My next few e-books are going to be a guide to vim, a practical guide to anonymity online, and the catonmat book that will contain all my best articles.


Sincerely,
